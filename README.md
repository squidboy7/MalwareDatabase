### Malware Disambiguation
The current malware sectors are:
- Exploits - Tools to hack other's computers;
- Worm - A virus that eplicates itself in order to spread to other computers;
- Trojan - A piece of malware that disguises itself as a normal file as to trick users into opening it/running it;
- Ransomware - A type of malware from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's personal data or perpetually block access to it unless/until a ransom is paid.
- Jokes - Software that pretends to be of malicous intent yet is safe to run on a real machine
- Rogues - Malicious software and internet fraud that misleads users into believing there is a virus on their computer and aims to convince them to pay for a fake malware removal tool that (usually) actually installs malware on their computer.

**Of course, [I](https://github.com/Vichingo455) create malware too :) - my best would be Ultra Defender**
