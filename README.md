- Trojans - A piece of malware that disguises itself as an ordinary file/executable as to trick users into opening it/running it;
- Ransomware - A cryptovirological piece of malware that threatens to publish the victim's personal data or perpetually block access to it unless/until a ransom is paid;
- Jokes - Software that pretends to be of malicious intent yet is safe to run on an active machine;
- Rogues - Malicious software and internet fraud that misleads users into believing there is a virus on their computer and aims to convince them to pay for a fake malware removal tool that (usually) actually installs malware on their computer.

**Of course, [I](https://github.com/Vichingo455) create malware too :) - my best would be Ultra Defender**
